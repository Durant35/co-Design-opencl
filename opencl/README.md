# opencl 

## task
transplant opencv code of line detection、vehicle detection to opencl platform  
use parallel computing to reduce the time consuming

### team work
小组组成：陈坚达，陈上宇，陈胜杰，谷枫，柯柳，陈秋良  


### algorithm description
1. lane detection
2. vehicle detection
2.2

### time schedule
1. install opencl sdk, and try opencl demo  --done
2. read the opencv code of linedetection、vehicle detection.  --done
3. analysis the program and find the part that can be conpute parallel to save time --done part 
4. try to transplant the cv code to opencl code, basicly, write the kernel function. -- done part
5. modify the code and do optimazation -- TBD
6. write report and final pre --TBD
